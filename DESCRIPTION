Title: Widen, Process, then Re-Tidy Data
Version: 0.1.0.9000
Authors@R: c(person("David", "Robinson", email = "admiral.david@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre")),

Description: Encapsulates the pattern of untidying data into a wide matrix,
  performing some processing, then turning it back into a tidy form. This
  is useful for several operations such as co-occurrence counts,
  correlations, or clustering that are mathematically convenient on wide matrices.
